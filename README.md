## Key Points:
• The meteor speed peaks northward in the local morning and shifts clockwise to southward by local evening
• Meteor speed distribution has two Gaussian peaks at∼28 and∼54 km/s, revealing semi‐annual and annual variation cycles respectively
• Major meteor showers occur with 45%–97% higher counts than the background, and are associated with increases in the peak speeds

## Abstract
Meteor speed is crucial in identifying key astronomical aspects of the meteoroid environment,
including the influx of meteoric material and the distribution of meteoric radiants. This study investigates
diurnalandseasonalvariationsofmeteorspeedfromApril2014toDecember2023observedbytheMengcheng
meteorradar(MCMR;33.4°N,116.3°E).Inadditiontotheexpecteddiurnalvariationofmeteorspeed,azimuth

meteor speed peaks northward in the local morning and shifts clockwise, we find that the meteor speed

ranging from 20 to 40 (45–65) km/s. The two speed peaks are estimated using a double‐Gaussian fitting
approach. In terms of seasonal variation, we find that (a) the low‐speed peak indicates a semi‐annual variation
cycle, with maxima in June–July and December–January, and minima in February and August; (b) the high‐
speed peak indicates an annual variation cycle, with maxima in September–December and minima in March.
There is also a correlation between the seasonal variations in the meteor speed peaks and the occurrence of

background count on corresponding event dates and speeds.
