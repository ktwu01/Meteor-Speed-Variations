## Key Points:
- The meteor speed peaks northward in the local morning and shifts clockwise to southward by local evening

- Meteor speed distribution has two Gaussian peaks at ∼28 and ∼54 km/s, revealing semi-annual and annual variation cycles respectively

- Major meteor showers occur with 45%–97% higher counts than the background, and are associated with increases in the peak speeds

## Abstract
Meteor speed is crucial in identifying key astronomical aspects of the meteoroid environment, including the influx of meteoric material and the distribution of meteoric radiants. This study investigates diurnal and seasonal variations of meteor speed from April 2014 to December 2023 observed by the Mengcheng meteor radar (MCMR; 33.4°N, 116.3°E). In addition to the expected diurnal variation of meteor speed, azimuth peak, zenith peak, and the azimuthal direction of maximum meteor speed due to the Earth's rotation, where the meteor speed peaks northward in the local morning and shifts clockwise, we find that the meteor speed distribution resembles a superposition of two Gaussian distributions, with the lower (higher) distribution mainly ranging from 20 to 40 (45–65) km/s. The two speed peaks are estimated using a double-Gaussian fitting approach. In terms of seasonal variation, we find that (a) the low-speed peak indicates a semi-annual variation cycle, with maxima in June–July and December–January, and minima in February and August; (b) the high-speed peak indicates an annual variation cycle, with maxima in September–December and minima in March. There is also a correlation between the seasonal variations in the meteor speed peaks and the occurrence of meteor showers. Statistical analysis provides a map of seasonal variations in the intensity, duration, and timing of meteor shower activities, which is supplemental to previous shorter-duration studies using backscatter meteor radar observations. We also find notable shower events where the meteor counts exceed 45%–97% of the background count on corresponding event dates and speeds.

## Plain Language Summary
Meteor speed plays a crucial role in understanding the quantity and distribution of meteoroids in our environment, yet there are limited observations and investigations conducted at mid-latitudes. In this study, we utilized a meteor radar located in Mengcheng (in the northern lower middle latitudes) to investigate diurnal and seasonal variations in meteor speed from April 2014 to June 2023. Our findings revealed that meteor speed is generally faster in the morning and slower in the afternoon and evening, and the angle of arrival of meteors varies with local time. Additionally, we discovered that meteor speed exhibits two peaks, with the lower one at about 28 km/s and the higher one at 54 km/s. Seasonal changes indicated a semi-annual variation cycle in the low-speed peak and an annual variation cycle in the high-speed peak. Furthermore, we observed several noteworthy meteor showers and their interannual variations.
